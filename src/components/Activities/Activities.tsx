        <p>
          I love diving, my mom loves me spearfishing. 
          Diving under the waves have shown me a whole new world, a world full of seafood: tuna, bass, lobster, scallops, mussels, urchins...
          which my mother would dig out like treasure from my 200 qt. cooler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scuba diving has challenged and shown me with so many different perspectives of the world. 
          From being a student, to teaching classes, and saving distressed divers, I've learned and grown in profound ways.

          I started rock climbing about 2 years ago, and since then, it has been
          nothing short of amazing (maybe even <em>addicting</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the challenge of finding the optimal "beta" through a problem,
          and pushing your body to it's limit.

        <p>
          I joined PCT (a professional business fraternity) my very first
          semesert at BU. It was probably one of the most impactful decsions
          I've made in terms of the <strong>friends</strong> made,{" "}
          <strong>skills</strong> acquired, and abundance of unique experiences.

        <p>
          Growing up, I always had the opportunity to watch my mom cook, and
          even help out in the kitchen. Once my parents started working more, I
          ended up taking more responsibility for cooking meals for the whole
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          This slowly grew into a passion, and now is something that I spend a
          lot of free time doing for fun!
