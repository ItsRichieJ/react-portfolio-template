          I love diving, my mom loves me spearfishing. 
          Diving under the waves have shown me a whole new world, a world full of seafood: tuna, bass, lobster, scallops, mussels, urchins...
          which my mother would dig out like treasure from my 200 qt. cooler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scuba diving has challenged and shown me with so many different perspectives of the world. 
          From being a student, to teaching classes, and saving distressed divers, I've learned and grown in profound ways.

          Pet sitting was first a method to fund my 9 year-old self's want for Star Wars Legos. 
          I also could not stand leaving my own pet at home, all alone, in the dark. So I sought out to provide a solution for pets that have traveling parents.
          Throughout the years, I've taken care of over 50 breeds of dogs and met wonderful parents.
          The corgi in my arms, I've known "Pillow" since she was 8 months old, she's now nine and has spent over half her life at my house; we are great friends with her owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I was able to buy my Star Wars Legos, and even my first car!

          I joined PCT (a professional business fraternity) my very first
          semesert at BU. It was probably one of the most impactful decsions
          I've made in terms of the <strong>friends</strong> made,{" "}
          <strong>skills</strong> acquired, and abundance of unique experiences.

        <p>
          Growing up, I always had the opportunity to watch my mom cook, and
          even help out in the kitchen. Once my parents started working more, I
          ended up taking more responsibility for cooking meals for the whole
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          This slowly grew into a passion, and now is something that I spend a
          lot of free time doing for fun!
